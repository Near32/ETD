# About

This repository implements **Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance(ETD)**, an exploration method for reinforcement learning that has been found to be particularly effective in Contextual MDPs(CMDP). More details can be found in the original paper([ICLR 2025 Accepted](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=I7DeajDEx7)). In case you are mainly interested in the implementation of ETD, its major components can be found at `ppo_etd/algo/intrinsic_rewards/tdd.py.` We also provide a reproduction of the temporal distance learning in maze, please refer to `maze/train_cmd1.py`. 

# Install

### Basic Installation

```bash
conda create -n etd python=3.9
conda activate etd
pip install -r requirements.txt
# from PPO/ETD/
pip install -e .
```

### Miniworld

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ppo_etd/env/gym_miniworld
pip install pyglet==1.5.11
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

### Reproduce Temporal Distance Learning in Maze

```bash
cd maze
python train_cmd1.py
```

### Train ETD on MiniGrid

Run the below command from the `PPO/ETD` directory to train a ETD agent in the standard *DoorKey-8x8* (MiniGrid) environment.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=./ python3 -m ppo_etd.train \\
  --int_rew_source=TDD \\
  --env_source=minigrid \\
  --game_name=DoorKey-8x8 \\
  --int_rew_coef=1e-2
```

We also provide scripts`(*.sh)` to run the experiments of our method. The hyperparameter setup can be found in our paper.
